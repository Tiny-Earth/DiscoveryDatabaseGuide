# Add Teaching Assistants

If you have TAs, you may wish to give them permission to manage portions of your course in the database. Otherwise, you may skip this step.

TAs have the same permissions as instructors, except they cannot create classes/sections or manage other TAs. They can add students to their classes/sections, see student database entries in their classes/sections, and edit, delete, and finalize those database entries.

To add TAs:

1. Instruct your TAs to create database accounts, following the same process and using the same Invitation Code as your students. We recommend you share the [Getting Started](register.md) page of this guide with your TAs, as it explains the process to them. If you do not have a valid Invitation Code to give your TAs, please contact <tinyearth@wid.wisc.edu>
2. Once your TAs have made their accounts, visit [Manage Classes](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/classroom-management/)
3. If you have multiple classes or sections, select the class you want to add TAs to from the dropdown
4. Under "Add to Classroom," enter the email addresses your TAs used to create their accounts, separated by commas
5. Click "Add as Assistants"

You should now see your TAs listed on your course as Assistants. If there were any errors adding their accounts (usually from an incorrect email address), a message will be displayed at the top of the screen.

You TAs will now see a [Manage Classes](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/classroom-management/) tab on their view of the database as well.

The remaining steps of this guide can now be completed by either you or your TAs.

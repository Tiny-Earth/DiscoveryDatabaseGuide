# Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create an account on the [Discovery Database](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/).

Students and Teaching Assistants create their accounts on the [Discovery Database](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/) website, then are added to their course by the instructor.

Instructors accounts have higher permissions, and are either (a) created as a student account during a training, webinar, or workshop and then promoted to an instructor account, or (b) created using an Instructor Invitation Code without going through a training first. Please contact <tinyearth@wid.wisc.edu> for assistance and questions.

## Students and Teaching Assistants

## Instructors

If you already have an account that has student access but not instructor access, such as from a webinar or training, please reach out to <tinyearth@wid.wisc.edu> to have your account promoted.

If you do not already have an account, but were given an Instructor Invitation Code, please follow the instructions above using your instructor Invitation Code.

Otherwise, please reach out to <tinyearth@wid.wisc.edu> to receive a code and setup instructions.

!!! warning "What access to a test classroom?"
    After instructor accounts are created, they can be manually added to a test classroom in the "TEPI University" institution by messaging <tinyearth@wid.wisc.edu>, allowing instructors to experiment with database features.

    Once you are added to the test classroom, we will notify you, and you may then continue to the next step of the guide, [adding your first entry](first-entry.md)

If you have problems or questions, reach out to <tinyearth@wid.wisc.edu>

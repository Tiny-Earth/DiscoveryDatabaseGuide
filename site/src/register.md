# Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create an account on the Discovery Database.

Students and Teaching Assistants create their accounts on the Discovery Database website, then are added to their course by the instructor.

Instructors accounts have higher permissions, and are created after a form has been completed.

## Students and Teaching Assistants

1. Visit <https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/registration/>
2. Complete the form, filling in your name, display name, and email. Create a password you will use to log into the database, and input the Invitation Code you were given by your instructor
3. Submit the form and await an activation email
4. Click the link in the activation email to finish creating your account
5. Notify your instructor that your account is complete so they can add you to their course, then visit <https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/> and log in -- let's begin!

# Finalize Student Entries

Once student work in your class or on an entry is complete, and you have reviewed that the work meets your bar for quality research record-keeping, you may finalize those student entries.

!!! warning "Finalized Entries Cannot be Edited"
    Entries that have been given the blue "Finalized" status tag *cannot* be edited further by students or instructors.

!!! note ""
    ```yuml
    [Student enters data] -> [Instructor finalizes] -> [Tiny Earth posts to Public Database]
    ``` Students enter data into the Discovery Database. Instructors review and finalize that data. And Tiny Earth posts finalized data to the Public Database.

    Students can explore all previously finalized Tiny Earth student data on the [Tiny Earth Public Database](https://publicdata.tinyearth.wisc.edu/)!

To finalize entries:

1. View your student entries, as described in the [View Student Entries](viewing.md) page of this guide
2. Select the "finalize" view by changing the "Change View" dropdown and clicking the "Change View" button 
3. Select the entries you wish to finalize by checking the box next to them, then click "Finalize Displayed Selected Entries"
4. A summary of what entries were finalized will be shown at the top of the page

!!! warning "Finalizing Limited to 250 Entries at Once"
    In order to limit impact on database performance for all users, you may only finalize up to 250 entries at a time.

    With this in mind, it is recommended that you finalize in smaller batches, such as for single students or groups at a time, or at multiple times throughout the semester.

!!! warning "Finalizing Moves Upstream"
    When you finalize an entry, all entries that it refers to will also be finalized, and so on.

    For example, if you finalize a Streak Plate, this will also finalize the Isolate that it refers to, as well as the Environmental Sample that the Isolate refers to.

    If an entry cannot be finalized (such as by missing required information), then all entries that it is upstream of cannot be finalized either.

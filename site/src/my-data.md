# My Data

!!! warning "Page Under Development"
    This portion of the Discovery Database is still under development. While this page of the workshop should serve to get you started, it may be out-of-date with the most recent version of the database itself.

While your "My Entries" page is your one stop shop for creating entries, your "My Data" page is where you can:

- Perform an advanced search through entries you are an author or coauthor on
- Generate an excel or PDF report to turn into your instructor summarizing all your database work

## Views

By default, your "My Data" table shows a small amount of general information about all of your entries, regardless of what type of entry they are. This can be useful when you need to confirm that your authorshop/coauthorship across all your entries is correct.

You can change the "Select entry view" dropdown to change what entry types should be the focus of your search.

## Generating Excel and PDF Files

1. Select the view that best represents what you want to share with your instructor, such as "aa-screen-library" to summarize your library screening results
2. If needed, change the "Show __ entries" dropdown to show all entries of the selected type
3. If needed, filter the results using the view's available dropdown menus
4. Use the "Column visibility" selector to disable columns that you do not need to include in your report, such as the ID of a screen, Authors, and Sample ID. Confirm that all information you need to report out is shown on your screen
5. Click the Excel, PDF, and/or Print buttons to export the displayed information in the format you need

Now that you know how to search through your database entries in more advanced ways and how to generate reports for your instructor, recall that science is collaborative, and the research you are conducting in this course can be built on by others! Next, let's talk about entry Front Pages, which show all entries that refer to them, even those by students in other classes!

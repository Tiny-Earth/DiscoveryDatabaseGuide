# View Student Entries

To view your students' entries:

1. Once your students have created entries you would like to view, visit [Manage Classes](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/classroom-management/)
2. If you have multiple classes or sections, select the class/section you want to view
3. Click "View Class Entries." This link is located above the form where you added students by email to your course
4. You will now see an interface similar to your "My Data" page, except it shows data for all of your students entries in your course

Depending on your task, you may find it useful to:

- View an individual student or group's work by selecting them from the "Author(s)" dropdown
- View all entries of a certain type by selecting the type from the "Change View" dropdown
- Quickly find an entry from its nickname by using the "Nickname" dropdown
- Change which information is shown or hidden with the "Column visibility" dropdown
- See an entry's Front Page by clicking its ID
- Export the information for viewing in another tool by using the "Excel," "PDF," or "Print" buttons

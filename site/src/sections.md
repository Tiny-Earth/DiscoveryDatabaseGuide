# Add Course Sections

If you have a large course with several sections, you may wish to split your classroom data into sections to ease course management.

To do this:

1. Visit [Manage Classes](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/classroom-management/)
2. Click "+ Create a new classroom" then "Add New Classroom." The same form you used to create your first classroom should appear
3. Creating a course section follows the same process as creating a course, except:
    - Set the "Main Classroom" to the main classroom that the section belongs to
    - Include the section number in the slug, such as "uwmadison-plpath-145-001-sp23"

When you add TAs and students, you may do so at the whole-course level or to individual sections. TAs and students will only be able to interact with information for the course or sections they are added to.

# Entry Front Pages

To view an entry's Front Page, locate the entry on your "My Entries" page and click "View Front Page" under it.

An entry's Front Page is very similar to its information on your "My Entries" page, and it has many of the same features: You can edit, duplicate, and add new entries referencing the one you are looking at.

A Front Page however shows *more* information. Your "My Entries" page only shows entries that you are an author or coauthor on, while a Front Page shows all information about an entry and all entries that reference it -- regardless of who the author is!

More importantly, your entries' Front Pages show what the information you've recorded will eventually look like to the *outside world*!

Once your entries have been finalized by your instructor and their Front Pages have been exported to the Tiny Earth Public Database by the Tiny Earth team, they'll be viewable by future researchers for years to come! Plus, it'll be where you can stay up-to-date on how other researchers are building on what you contributed to the Discovery Database in this class!

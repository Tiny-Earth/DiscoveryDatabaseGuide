# Entry Front Pages

To view an entry's Front Page, locate the entry on your [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/) page and click the entry's "View Front Page" link.

An entry's Front Page is very similar to what is shown on your [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/) page, and it has many of the same features: You can edit, duplicate, and add new entries referencing the one you are looking at.

However, a Front Page shows *more* information. Your [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/) page only shows entries that you are an author or coauthor on, while a Front Page shows all information about an entry and all entries that reference it -- regardless of who the author is!

More importantly, your Front Pages show what the information you've recorded will eventually look like to the *other students* searching the [Discovery Database](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/)!

And once your entries have been finalized by your instructor, your entries' data will be exported to the [Tiny Earth Public Database](https://publicdata.tinyearth.wisc.edu/) by the Tiny Earth team, where their data will be viewable by future researchers for years to come! Plus, it'll be where you can stay up-to-date on how other researchers are building on what you contributed to the Discovery Database in this class!

If you're a student -- congrats, you've reached the end of the guide! Return here as often as you need for reference, check out the [Entry Types](entries/index.md) pages as needed, and we hope you have a great time! Thank you for contributing to science!

And if you are an instructor -- you're half way there! Continue reading to learn how to setup and manage your courses.

# Add Students

Once you've created your course and added any sections or TAs you might need, you are ready to add your students!

To add students:

1. Instruct your students to create database accounts, using the student Invitation Code you were given by Tiny Earth HQ. We recommend you share the [Getting Started](register.md) page of this guide with your students, as it explains the process to them. If you do not have a valid Invitation Code to give your students, please contact `TODO email`
2. Once your students have made their accounts, visit [Manage Classes](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/classroom-management/)
3. If you have multiple classes or sections, select the class you want to add TAs to from the dropdown
4. Under "Add to Classroom," enter the email addresses your students used to create their accounts, separated by commas
5. Click "Add as Students"

You should now see your students listed in your course. If there were any errors adding their accounts (usually from an incorrect email address), a message will be displayed at the top of the screen.

Your students will now be able to view their [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/) tab without receiving any error messages.

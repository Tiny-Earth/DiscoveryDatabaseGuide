## Required Information

- **Date:** The date the plate was first created

## Optional Information

- **Nickname:** It may be useful to give your susceptability test a short name to distinguish exactly what isolate the data is supporting. Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully.
- **Isolate:** Click the "add Isolate" button to link an isolate to this entry. This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add antibio-suscept" to an existing isolate.
- **Media Used** and **Concentration of Media Used:** The base media used to cultivate the plate and its concentration. For example, commonly when the Media Used is TSA, the Concentration is 10%. Confirm with your instructor the concentration of your media !!! 
- **Additives** and **Concentration of Additives:** Additives to the media, such as antifungals, and their concentration (in ug/mL). Confirm with your instructor the additives to your media and their concentration.
- **Media Modification:** A description of other modifications you made to your media, such as adding honey, essential oils, cinnamon, or so on. Many students like to test the effect of such treatments on their isolates -- that treatment would be recorded here.
- **Incubation Temperature** and **Duration:** The temperature (in Celsius) and the duration (in Hours) that the plate was incubated.
- **Antibiotic Susceptibilities:** Here, you will be able to list the antibiotics that you are testing. If you are testing an antibiotic that is not listed, talk to your instructor for guidance on how to proceed. You may list multiple tests in one entry. To create another listing, hover over the far right column until you see a "+" sign. When you create a new row, it will appear exactly where you chose to hit the "+" sign. You can rearrange these rows by hovering over the far left column until a move cursor appears. Finally, don't forget to type the concentration and select the bubble indicating the results of each test.

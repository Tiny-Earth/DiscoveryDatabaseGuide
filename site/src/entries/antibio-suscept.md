# Antibiotic Susceptibility Test

In some Tiny Earth courses, students will test the susceptibility of their Isolates to known antibiotic drugs, such as Penicillin. Record the results of these tests using an Antibiotic Susceptibility Test entry. To create an entry of this type, visit [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/), locate the Isolate that was tested, and click "Add antibio-suscept" under that Isolate.

## Use This Entry to Record

- Test results of an Isolate's susceptibility to various known antibiotic drugs

## Required Information

- **Date:** The date the plate was first created
- **Isolate:** This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add antibio-suscept" under an existing Isolate. If it is not automatically populated, you can search through the dropdown box and select the Isolate that you are working on. If a teammate created the Isolate entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it in your entries. Click the "add new" button only if you need to create a new Isolate from scratch to link to this entry.
- **Antibiotic Tested:** Under the prompt titled antibiotic susceptibilities, you will notice that the only required results are the antibiotics that are being tested. For more information on how to list your results, see the antibiotic susceptibilities field under optional information below.
- **Media Used:** The base media used to cultivate the plate.

## Optional Information

- **Nickname:** It may be useful to give your susceptability test a short name to distinguish exactly what isolate the data is supporting. Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully.
- **Concentration of Media Used:** The concentration of the base media used to cultivate the plate. For example, commonly when the Media Used is TSA, the Concentration is 10%. Confirm with your instructor the concentration of your media. 
- **Additives** and **Concentration of Additives:** Additives to the media, such as antifungals, and their concentration (in ug/mL). Confirm with your instructor the additives to your media and their concentration.
- **Media Modification:** A description of other modifications you made to your media, such as adding honey, essential oils, cinnamon, or so on. Many students like to test the effect of such treatments on their isolates -- that treatment would be recorded here.
- **Incubation Temperature** and **Duration:** The temperature (in Celsius) and the duration (in Hours) that the plate was incubated.
- **Antibiotic Susceptibilities:** Here, you will be able to list the antibiotics that you are testing. If you are testing an antibiotic that is not listed, talk to your instructor for guidance on how to proceed. You may list multiple tests in one entry. To create another listing, hover over the far right column until you see a "+" sign. When you create a new row, it will appear exactly where you chose to hit the "+" sign. You can rearrange these rows by hovering over the far left column until a move cursor appears. Finally, don't forget to type the concentration and select the bubble indicating the results of each test.

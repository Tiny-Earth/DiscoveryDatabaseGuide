# Antibiotic Activity Screen: Isolate

Isolate Antibiotic Activity Screens are used to identify which of several tests an Isolate does or does not show antibiobic activity against. To create an entry of this type, visit [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/), locate the Isolate that was screened, and click "Add aa-screen-isolate" under that Isolate.

## Use This Entry to Record

- Antibiotic activity screen results for a single Isolate against several ESKAPEs

## Required Information

- **Date:** The date the plate was first created.
- **Isolate:** This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add aa-screen-isolate" under an existing Isolate. If it is not automatically populated, you can search through the dropdown box and select the Isolate that you are working on. If a teammate created the Isolate entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it in your entries. Click the "add new" button only if you need to create a new Isolate from scratch to link to this entry.
- **Screens:** At the bottom of the page, you will be prompted to select the ESKAPE safe relative that you are screening against and whether or not antibiotic activity was observed. If you are screening against multiple ESKAPE safe relatives, you should create a new row for each screening. You are also prompted to list what kind of activity was observed.
- **Media Used:** The base media used to cultivate the plate.

## Optional Information

- **Nickname:** When you have several Isolate Plates, it may be useful to give them short names to help distinguish them. Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully.
- **Concentration of Media Used:** The concentration of the base media used to cultivate the plate. For example, commonly when the Media Used is TSA, the Concentration is 10%. Confirm with your instructor the concentration of your media.
- **Additives** and **Concentration of Additives:** Additives to the media, such as antifungals, and their concentration (in ug/mL). Confirm with your instructor the additives to your media and their concentration.
- **Incubation Temperature** and **Duration:** The temperature (in Celsius) and the duration (in hours) that the plate was incubated.

# Antibiotic Activity Screen: Extract

Similar to Isolate Antibiotic Activity Screens, Extract Antibiotic Activity Screens are used to identify which of several tests an Extract does or does not show antibiobic activity against. To create an entry of this type, visit [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/), locate the Chemical Extract that the screened, and click "Add aa-screen-extract" under that Chemical Extract.

## Use This Entry to Record

- Antibiotic activity screen results for a single Extract against several ESKAPEs

## Required Information

- **Date:** The date the plate was first created.
- **Chemical Extract:** This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add aa-screen-extract" under an existing Chemical Extract. If it is not automatically populated, you can search through the dropdown box and select the Chemical Extract that you are working on. If a teammate created the Chemical Extract entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it in your entries. Click the "add new" button only if you need to create a new Chemical Extract from scratch to link to this entry.
- **Screens:** At the bottom of the page, you will be prompted to select the ESKAPE safe relative that you are screening against and whether or not antibiotic activity was observed. If you are screening against multiple ESKAPE safe relatives, you should create a new row for each screening. You are also prompted to list what kind of activity was observed. 

## Optional Information

- **Media Used** and **Concentration of Media Used:** The base media used to cultivate the plate and its concentration. For example, commonly when the Media Used is TSA, the Concentration is 10%. Confirm with your instructor the concentration of your media. If you find yourself using a media that is not listed, talk to your instructor for guidance.
- **Additives** and **Concentration of Additives:** Additives to the media, such as antifungals, and their concentration (in ug/mL). Confirm with your instructor the additives to your media and their concentration.
- **Media Modification:** A description of other modifications you made to your media, such as adding honey, essential oils, cinnamon, or so on. Many students like to test the effect of such treatments on their isolates- that treatment would be recorded here.
- **Incubation Temperature** and **Duration:** The temperature (in Celsius) and the duration (in hours) that the plate was incubated.

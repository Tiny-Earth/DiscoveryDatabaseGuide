- **Isolate:** You can search for and select the isolate that is being tested. This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add microbio-char" to an existing isolate.

Here, you can list the test date, protocol, results, cell shape, and cell size.

Be sure provide give details to your protocol description and clarify with your instructor if you have any questions.
- **Other Tests:** You can add more characterization tests to your entry as they are conducted. First select the test that you are conducting or write in the name of the test if it is not provided.

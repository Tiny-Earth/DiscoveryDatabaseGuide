# Microbiological Characterization

Many Tiny Earth classes perform additional tests on Isolates before or after screening them for antibiotic activity, such as Gram staining. Use Microbiological Characterizations to record these. To create an entry of this type, visit [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/), locate the Isolate that was tested, and click "Add microbio-char" under that Isolate.

## Use This Entry to Record

- Additional test results on an Isolate, such as Gram Stain Tests, Motility Tests, and so on

## Required Information

- **Date:** The date the plate was first created.
- **Isolate:** This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add microbio-char" under an existing Isolate. If it is not automatically populated, you can search through the dropdown box and select the Isolate that you are working on. If a teammate created the Isolate entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it in your entries. Click the "add new" button only if you need to create a new Isolate from scratch to link to this entry.

## Optional Information

- **Nickname:** It may be useful to give your microbiological characterization entries a short name to distinguish exactly what isolate the information is supporting. Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully.
- **Gram Stain Test:** This entry item is a box specifically designed to house information regarding the gram stain test. Here, you can list the test date, protocol, results, cell shape, and cell size. You can add your own custom options for cell shape if you feel that none of the provided options accurately represent what you see on the plate. Be sure provide give details to your protocol description and clarify with your instructor if you have any questions.
- **Other Tests:** You can add more characterization tests to your entry as they are conducted. First select the test that you are conducting or write in the name of the test if it is not provided. Then you can add the date, protocol, and results. You may add as many characterization tests as you feel are necessary.

# Streak Plate

A Streak Plate is used to capture pure colonies of an Isolate that was discovered on a Serial Dilution Plate or Library Plate that contained colonies of possible several other microbes. To create an entry of this type, visit [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/), locate the Isolate that was streaked, and click "Add streak" under that Isolate.

## Use This Entry to Record

- Morphology of a streak of an isolate as cultivated under certain conditions

## Required Information

- **Date:** The date the plate was first created.
- **Isolate:** This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add streak" under an existing Isolate. If it is not automatically populated, you can search through the dropdown box and select the Isolate that you are working on. If a teammate created the Isolate entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it in your entries. Click the "add new" button only if you need to create a new Isolate from scratch to link to this entry.

## Optional Information

- **Nickname:** Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully.
- **Media Used** and **Concentration of Media Used:** The base media used to cultivate the plate and its concentration. For example, commonly when the Media Used is TSA, the Concentration is 10%. Confirm with your instructor the concentration of your media.
- **Additives** and **Concentration of Additives:** Additives to the media, such as antifungals, and their concentration (in ug/mL). Confirm with your instructor the additives to your media and their concentration.
- **Media Modification:** A description of other modifications you made to your media, such as adding honey, essential oils, cinnamon, or so on. Many students like to test the effect of such treatments on their isolates- that treatment would be recorded here.
- **Incubation Temperature** and **Duration:** The temperature (in Celsius) and the duration (in hours) that the plate was incubated.
- **Morphology:** Provide details of the characteristics seen on your streak plate. If none of the provided options accurately describe your morphology characteristics, feel free to add your own. 
- **Pure Culture:** If you select "no" on the toggle, indicating that multiple morphologies were observed, a box will appear prompting you to add a new isolate to the entry. Here, you can either select an existing isolate or create a new one. You will be prompted to also fill in the characteristics of this isolate as well. You can add as many isolates as necessary.

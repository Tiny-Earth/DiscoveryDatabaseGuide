- **Incubation Temperature** and **Duration:** The temperature (in Celsius) and the duration (in hours) that the plate was incubated.
- **Morphology:** Provide details of the characteristics seen on your streak plate. If none of the provided options accurately describe your morphology characteristics, feel free to add your own. 
- **Pure Culture:** If you select "no" on the toggle, indicating that multiple morphologies were observed, a box will appear prompting you to add a new isolate to the entry. Here, you can either select an existing isolate or create a new one. You will be prompted to also fill in the characteristics of this isolate as well. You can add as many isolates as necessary.

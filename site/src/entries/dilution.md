# Serial Dilution Plate

Serial Dilution Plates are the first stage of the Tiny Earth research flow in which students identify Isolates of their own. To create an entry of this type, visit "My Entries," locate the Environmental Sample that was diluted to create the Serial Dilution Plate, and click "Add dilution" under that Sample.

!!! tip "Recommended: Create Isolates First"
    This entry type refers to both Environmental Samples and Isolates. Because it records information about the position, morphology, and other details of an isolate on a plate, it may be simpler to create those Isolates first, then return here to record information about them in relation to this plate.

    And if you are working in a team and have coauthors to add to your Isolates, doing things in this order is *highly* recommended, as it will allow your teammates to track the same Isolates across your different research activities.

    So, before you begin to record this plate, first create an Isolate entry for each Isolate you wish to track on this plate. Creating an Isolate entry involves only three pieces of information: a nickname for the Isolate, the date it was first observed, and the Sample it originated from. Moreover, if you have coauthors to add to your Isolates, add them now.

    Then once you've completed and saved your Isolates, return here.

!!! tip "Recommended: Take a Picture"
    For entry types like this one that record the position of an Isolate on a plate, it is recommended that you take a clear photo of your plate, then mark up the image as needed in simple photo editing software, such Microsoft Paint, Google Slides, or <https://jspaint.app/>.
    
    For each Isolate on the plate you are tracking, clearly number its position on the plate with a high-contrast font.

    Then, when you record your information for this entry, upload the image under "Additional Notes" and reference the position numbers as needed when recording information about Isolates on this plate.

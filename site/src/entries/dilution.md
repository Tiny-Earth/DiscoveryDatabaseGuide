# Serial Dilution Plate

!!! tip "Recommended: Create Isolates First"
    This entry type refers to both Environmental Samples and Isolates. Because it records information about the position, morphology, and other details of an isolate on a plate, it may be simpler to create those Isolates first, then return here to record information about them in relation to this plate.

    And if you are working in a team and have coauthors to add to your Isolates, doing things in this order is *highly* recommended, as it will allow your teammates to track the same Isolates across your different research activities.

    So, before you begin to record this plate, first create an Isolate entry for each Isolate you wish to track on this plate. Creating an Isolate entry involves only three pieces of information: a nickname for the Isolate, the date it was first observed, and the Sample it originated from. Moreover, if you have coauthors to add to your Isolates, add them now.

    Then once you've completed and saved your Isolates, return here.

## Required Information

- **Nickname:** When you have several chemical extracts, it may be useful to give them short names to help distinguish them. Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully.
- **Isolate:** This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add chemical-extract" under an existing Isolate. If it is not automatically populated, you can search through the dropdown box and select the Isolate that you are working on. If a teammate created the Isolate entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it in your entries. Click the "add new" button only if you need to create a new Isolate from scratch to link to this entry.
- **Date:** The date the chemical extract was first created.

## Optional Information

- **Media Used** and **Concentration of Media Used:** The base media used to cultivate the plate and its concentration. For example, commonly when the Media Used is TSA, the Concentration is 10%. Confirm with your instructor the concentration of your media.
- **Additives** and **Concentration of Additives:** Additives to the media, such as antifungals, and their concentration (in ug/mL). Confirm with your instructor the additives to your media and their concentration.
- **Media Modification:** A description of other modifications you made to your media, such as adding honey, essential oils, cinnamon, or so on. Many students like to test the effect of such treatments on their isolates- that treatment would be recorded here.
- **Incubation Temperature** and **Duration:** The temperature (in Celsius) and the duration (in hours) that the plate was incubated.
- **Solid or Liquid Culture:** Select solid or liquid culture. Note that when you change your selection, the following prompts will change with it. When the selection is solid, you will be asked for the number of plates used. When the selection is liquid, you will be asked whether or not resin was used.
- **Drying Agent Used:** Clarify with your professor what your drying agent is if you are unsure. You may write in additional choices if you do not see your agent listed. 
- **Mass of Crude Extract:** Here you can list the crude mass of your extract. This should be the initial mass of the extract before the drying agents or solvents are applied.
- **Experimental Design:** Give details describing your experimental procedure.

## Required Information

- **Nickname:** When you have several Isolates, it may be useful to give them short names to help distinguish them. Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully. 
- **Date:** The date the isolate was first created.
- **Sample:** The environmental sample that was used to create this plate. This field is automatically populated for you if you click "add isolate" under an existing sample. If a teammate created the Environmental Sample entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it on your plates and isolates. 


## Optional Information

-The isolate page has many branches of further information to add via more entries. For this reason, there is no optional information that students choose to add. If you have more information you want looged directly with your isolate, feel free to add it via the text box at the bottom. Here you can add text, links, and photos to your entry.

# Isolate

For most Tiny Earth research and courses, the Isolate is the most important entry type. Isolate entries themselves are minimal--just a name, date, and the sample it came from. All other information about an Isolate is tracked in other entries that reference it, such as plates and screens where the Isolate occurred.

To create an entry of this type, visit "My Entries," locate the Environmental Sample that was the origin of the Isolate, and click "Add isolate" under that Sample.

## Use This Entry to Record

- The name and discovery date for an Isolate of interest

## Required Information

- **Nickname:** When you have several Isolates, it may be useful to give them short names to help distinguish them. Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully. 
- **Date:** The date the isolate was first identified.
- **Sample:** This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add isolate" under an existing sample. If it is not automatically populated, you can search through the dropdown box and select the sample that you are working on. If a teammate created the Environmental Sample entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it in your entries. Click the "add new" button only if you need to create a new Environmental Sample from scratch to link to this entry.

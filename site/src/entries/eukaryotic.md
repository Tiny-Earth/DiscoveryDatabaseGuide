# Eukaryotic Test

Similar to screening against ESKAPE bacteria, some Tiny Earth students also screen their Isolates against known eukaryotic organisms, such as slime mold or oomycete. Record these using Eukaryotic Tests. To create an entry of this type, visit [My Entries](https://discovery.tinyearth.wisc.edu/my-entries/), locate the Isolate that was tested, and click "Add eukaryotic" under that Isolate.

## Use This Entry to Record

- Result of screening an Isolate against a eukaryotic organism

## Required Information

- **Date:** The date the plate was first created.
- **Isolate:** This field is automatically populated for you if you click "Add eukaryotic" under an existing Isolate. If it is not automatically populated, you can search through the dropdown box and select the Isolate that you are working on. If a teammate created the Isolate entry, make sure that they have added you as a co-author so you may refer to it in your entries. Click the "add new" button only if you need to create a new Isolate from scratch to link to this entry.
- **Eukaryotic Organism:** Add the eukaryotic organism you are screening against from the provided list. If you need another organism to be added, you should reach out to your instructor. 

## Optional Information

- **Nickname:** If you have performed multiple Eukaryotic Tests, it may be useful to give them short names to help distinguish them. Please follow your instructor's guidelines on how to name entries meaningfully. 
- **Media Used** and **Concentration of Media Used:** The base media used to cultivate the plate and its concentration. For example, commonly when the Media Used is TSA, the Concentration is 10%. Confirm with your instructor the concentration of your media. 
- **Additives** and **Concentration of Additives:** Additives to the media, such as antifungals, and their concentration (in ug/mL). Confirm with your instructor the additives to your media and their concentration. 
- **Media Modification:** A description of other modifications you made to your media, such as adding honey, essential oils, cinnamon, or so on. Many students like to test the effect of such treatments on their isolates- that treatment would be recorded here. 
- **Incubation Temperature** and **Duration:** The temperature (in Celsius) and the duration (in hours) that the plate was incubated. 
- **Experimental Design:** Give details describing your experimental procedure. 
- **Results:** Here, you can provide a detailed written description of your test results. 
- **Isolate form:** Specify the state of the isolate during the time of the test. 
- **Eukaryotic inhibition:** Signify whether or not there was eukaryotic inhibition on the plate. This would be represented by zones of inhibition following the test.

# Create Your First Classroom

!!! warning "Page Under Development"
    This portion of the Discovery Database is still under development. While this page of the workshop should serve to get you started, it may be out-of-date with the most recent version of the database itself.

TODO:

- add yourself as an instructor and any co-instructors you may have
- sensible slug, like `institution-department-coursenumber`
- leave Parent/Main Classroom as None
- Description will be shown on the data entries page for your classroom, viewable by assistants, students, and anyone else viewing the finalized entries of your classroom

!!! warning "Classrooms Can Only be Deleted by Admins"
    TODO instructors can't delete classrooms, only admins can, use Report Issue

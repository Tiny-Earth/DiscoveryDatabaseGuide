# Welcome!

Welcome to the self-paced workshop for the Tiny Earth Discovery Database!

The Discovery Database is new database for Tiny Earth students, instructors, and researchers to log their experiments and findings. It is an overhaul of the previous system, and it has been designed to be:

- Stable
- Accessible
- Learner-centered
- And to reinforce the learning outcomes of Tiny Earth courses!

## Workshop

In this workshop students will learn:

- How to create an account and log into the Discovery Database
- How to create, edit, and duplicate database entries
- How to add and manage coauthors on their entries for tracking group work
- How to choose between different entry types for different Tiny Earth research tasks
- How to perform advanced searches of Discovery Database entries
- How to export their work as reports to be shared with their instructors
- And how their entries will be shared and contribute to Science outside the classroom!

And instructors will additionally learn:

- How to create and manage classrooms
- Optionally, how to add and manage sections to classrooms
- Optionally, how to add and manage teaching assistants to classrooms or sections
- How to add and manage students to classrooms
- And how to finalize student database entries, marking them ready for upload to the Tiny Earth Public Database

This workshop content has been designed to be used:

- As a reference during Tiny Earth courses
- As a component of Tiny Earth instructor trainings
- As a guide for existing Tiny Earth instructors coming from the previous database or who were using their own database system 
- And as a refresher students and instructors can refer to as much as they need

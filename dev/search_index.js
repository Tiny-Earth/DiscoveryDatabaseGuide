For example, sometimes a student may plate 16 isolates, but only need to record information about the screen results of three of them for a particular research question. In such a case, the student would enter a total of 16 across \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"Isolate Did Not Grow,\" and \"Inconclusive,\" and record the three isolates of interest in the Isolate Selection Interface. For \"Yes,\" count the total number of isolates on the plate which formed clear zones of inhibition. For \"No,\" count those that clearly did not. For \"Isolate Did Not Grow,\" count the number of isolates which were plated but did not form colonies. And for \"Inconclusive,\" record the number of isolates for which it is hard to make a judgment one way or the other","category":"page"},{"location":"entries/aa-screen-library/#Isolate-Selection-Interface","page":"Antibiotic Activity Screen: Library","title":"Isolate Selection Interface","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"entries/aa-screen-library/","page":"Antibiotic Activity Screen: Library","title":"Antibiotic Activity Screen: Library","text":"After completing the rest of the fields for your plate, it is time to link the plate's entry to the Isolates you are tracking on it.
